# Critical: never scp directly over a live .so. The shim dlopen()s it, so
# overwriting the file mutates the mmap'd code pages of a running process —
# which segfaults the whole firmware. Upload to a temp name, then mv:
# rename(2) is atomic and leaves the old inode intact for the running process.
#
# And a NEW FILE ON DISK IS NOT THE RUNNING ONE. The atomic mv swaps the
# directory entry while the chain host keeps the old inode mapped, so this
# script also asks the slot to re-load. Without that step an on-device
# loadtest passes against code the device is not playing.
