/* 4K EQ for Ableton Move (Schwung audio_fx module).
 *
 * The Move-facing parameter surface. Single source of truth: the DSP shell,
 * the chain_params JSON served via get_param, the state blob and ui_hierarchy
 * all iterate this table.
 *
 * ONE-TO-ONE WITH UPSTREAM. Every key, range and default below is copied from
 * kFourKParams in src/ported/daf-plugin/FourKEQParams.hpp, which is 4K EQ 2's
 * own parameter table. Nothing here is renamed, collapsed, re-scaled or
 * invented: a value set on this module means exactly what the same key means
 * in the desktop plugin, which is what lets the port be checked against it.
 *
 * That is why HPF and LPF each keep TWO parameters — frequency and enable —
 * rather than folding the enable into the bottom of the frequency knob. The
 * fold looks tidier and is wrong: `*_freq` carries a dial-marking CONTROL
 * coordinate, not audible Hz, and the two are not the same number (Brown HPF
 * control 16 -> 10.16 Hz audible; 16 Hz audible -> control 38.39). Upstream
 * decides the enables from AUDIBLE Hz in FourKEQPresetRuntime.hpp, so deriving
 * an enable from the control value switches the filter on for presets that
 * want it out — seven of the fourteen factory presets.
 *
 * The five upstream keys deliberately NOT given a knob, matching what the
 * desktop UI itself offers:
 *   saturation        hidden legacy slot; 4K EQ 2 has fixed native
 *                     nonlinearity driven by Input, and its own UI does not
 *                     expose this. Left at upstream's 0 default by the shell.
 *   ms_mode           retired; the DSP is always normal stereo.
 *   spectrum_prepost  desktop analyser source.
 *   show_graph        desktop window state.
 *   out_peak_l/r      output params (meters) — served through get_param.
 *
 * Factory presets are NOT a parameter here either, because they are not one
 * upstream. They are served as a preset-browser level so the fourteen names
 * stay exactly as Dusk Audio wrote them, instead of being cut to fit a 5-char
 * knob readout.
 *
 * Layout: ONE PAGE PER BAND, which is how the console reads and how the
 * plugin's own channel strip is arranged. Six pages, 22 params, no control
 * more than one page from the band it belongs to:
 *
 *   LF      Gain  Freq  Bell   HPF    HPF On
 *   LMF     Gain  Freq  Q
 *   HMF     Gain  Freq  Q
 *   HF      Gain  Freq  Bell   LPF    LPF On
 *   MASTER  Type  Ovrsmpl  Bypass  AutoGain  In  Out
 *   PRESET  (browser level — not knobs)
 *
 * The filters sit with the band they act on: the high-pass on LF, the
 * low-pass on HF. That is where you reach for them, and it keeps FILTERS
 * from being a page you have to remember exists.
 *
 * Pages are deliberately not filled to eight. A band page holding only its
 * own three or five controls is the point — nothing to hunt through.
 *
 * The DSP core and its parameter semantics are 4K EQ 2 by Dusk Audio
 * (GPL-3.0, github.com/dusk-audio/dusk-audio-plugins); see src/ported/.

 * — only the power-on choice differs, and it is measured rather than assumed.
 * On Move, 4x buys nothing audible over 1x: the response differs by at most
 * 0.05 dB on an 8 kHz shelf and 0.25 dB on a 16 kHz shelf. What 1x does cost
 * is aliasing from the always-on console nonlinearity (consoleSatAmount()
 * returns 0.25 native in Brown, 0.50 in Black, even with saturation at zero):
 * bin-centred FFT puts 9-14 kHz tones at -84 dBc in Brown and -71 dBc in
 * Black at -3 dBFS. 2x returns all of that to below -120 dBc for 23 samples
 * (0.52 ms) of latency and a fraction of a percent of a core. Brown at 1x is
 * clean enough for anything; Black at 1x is the case that grits.
 *
 * Everything else — including auto_gain Off — is upstream's own default and

 * stage, and matching it is what makes this port checkable. The Move's int16

/* Read-only readouts.
 *
 * These are NOT controls and are deliberately absent from fkq_params above,

 * the remote panel can only ever see keys the plugin lists in chain_params —
 * the manager seeds and re-reads exactly that set, so a value the DSP merely
 * computes never reaches a browser at all. Declaring them "access":"read"
 * gets them across without making them editable, and none of them appears in
 * any level's knobs[], so the stock knob grid never plans a cell for one.
 *
 * out_peak_l / out_peak_r are upstream's own output parameters. The rest are
 * shell-level: in_peak_l/r read the core's input meters, clip counts samples
 * clamped at the Move's int16 conversion (which happens outside the EQ
 * entirely), and curve is the response the panel draws.
 *
 * curve is type "string" on purpose: param_meta.mjs treats string as an
 * opaque kind, so nothing tries to render 128 comma-separated decibels as a
 * dial.

 * reports each guess as `viz-inferred`; declaring them turns those into

 *

 * but Brown/Black is a voicing choice, not an on/off state, and an on/off
